Then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth dwell in my soul and absorb its power, as the form of a beloved mistress has often done, I sigh to myself with longing: \"Oh, could I but express these conceptions? Could I impress on paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be a mirror of my soul, as my soul is a mirror of the infinite God!\"",

When the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of my impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which sustains and carries us, as it floats around us in everlasting bliss.

Could I impress on paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be a mirror of my soul, as my soul is a mirror of the infinite God! Hey, friend! But it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendor of these visions! A serene calm, like a sweet morning of spring, which I enjoy with all my heart, has possessed my entire soul. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.\""
